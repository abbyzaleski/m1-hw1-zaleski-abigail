First Assignment for AWT2

While completing this assignment, I did have some issues figuring out how to make sure that I was pulling and pushing the appropriate things in Git Bash through to GitHub. I realized that I had moved my folder to a different location locally, and I was working in a different folder than what I had originally began working in. This also led to some issues in styling my CSS. However, I was able to merge the branches and connect all of the work. 

I am still not super confident on the pushing and pulling concepts, particularly in the event of working in a group, but the refresh on GitHub was certainly helpful. Additionally, I have only ever worked in Atom, so there was a bit of a learning curve while working in VS Code. However, I am really enjoying some of the features on this program, so I think that I will end up liking it much better than Atom once I am more confortable with it.

The only outside source that I used for help on this assignment was our class lecture from this past Wednesday, 8/25/21.
